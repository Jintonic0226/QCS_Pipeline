<h2>Read Me</h2>
<p>Quality Control Standards pipeline was developed to faciliate the data analysis of Quality Control Standards in MALDI-MSI workflow developed by Berta-Cillero group in MERLN Maastricht. There are two pipelines. The pipeline #1 is used to evaluate the intra/interday batch effect in the QCS samples using relative standard deviation (RSD). The pipeline #2 is used to evaluate intra/interday batch effect in the QCS samples and also tissue homogenate samples. After evaluation, user can also choose to correct the occuring batch effect amongest multiple correction methods such as: Combat, WaveICA, NormAE, Total Ion Count normalization, and Internal Standard normalization.<p>
<p>Each pipeline consist of its own read me to follow through.<p>
<p>Requirements: Visual Code Studio or Anaconda.<p>
